# apt-on-mac
Get apt on mac

I got this script from a discord server, r/jailbreak its like the procursus to get apt with sileo on ios but it also works on mac because procursus would use zsh, haven't used it much but i can confirm it can install packages and stuff, but idk how good it is.

I found 2 scripts, haven't tested the second one but i guess it can't be that bad
