Get apt on mac

I got this script from a discord server, r/jailbreak its like the procursus to get apt with sileo on ios but it also works on mac because procursus would use zsh, haven't used it much but i can confirm it can install packages and stuff, but idk how good it is.

I found 2 scripts, haven't tested the second one but i guess it can't be that bad

Maybe im dumb and its easy to find online, but i myself searched for a while when i would be using a mac (which i miss a lot) and i never found anything like that, everything would sent me to homebrew which i do obviously recommend. Hope it help some of yall :)
